    <h1>Some of my favorite elements of the Periodic Table</h1>
    <p> For context, Chemistry is one of my favorite subjects, so I decided to make my website based on some of my favorite elements :) </p>

    <h2> 
      Roses 
    </h2>
    <p>The rose might be the most famous type of flower, and even Shakespeare wrote about it.  (<a href="rose.html">Learn more.</a>)
    <h2> 
      Daisies 
    </h2>
    <p>Daisies aren't as famous as roses, but they are a pretty, everyday flower. If you want to learn more about daisies, I have a page at <a href="daisy.html">daisy.html</a>.</p>
    <h2> 
      Sunflower
    </h2>
    <p>The last flower is the sunflower, which is also the only one on the list that creates yummy seeds to eat.  I hope you like it, too. <a href="sunflower.html">Please click on my link to learn more about sunflowers, because you for sure will not regret it!</a></p>
