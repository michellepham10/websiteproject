    <h1>Some of my Favorite Elements of the Periodic Table </h1>
    <p> For context, Chemistry is one of my favorite subjects, so I decided to make my website based on some of my favorite elements :) </p>

    <p> After watching, click on the title of the element you'd like to learn more about. Have fun! </p>
