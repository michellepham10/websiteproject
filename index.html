    <h1>My Favorite Elements of the Periodic Table </h1>
    <p> For context, Chemistry is one of my favorite subjects, so I decided to make my website based on some of my favorite elements :) </p>
    <p> If you'd like a fun song to introduce yourself to, or, get a refresher on the periodic table, watch the music video below! </p>
    <p> After watching, click on the title of the element you'd like to learn more about. Have fun! </p>

      <a href="carbon.html">Carbon</a>
    </h2>
    <p> One of the most fundamental elements within our universe is carbon! Because every living organism relies on it, life is not possible without it. In fact, Organic Chemistry, of the largest studies within science, is built upon studying carbon. </p>
    <h2> 
      <a href="oxygen.html">Oxygen</a>
    </h2>
    <p> It's no surprise that oxygen would be on this list since its essential for every human life. It's all around within the air, and it plays a key role in how we breath, a process otherwise known as cellular respiration.</p>
    <h2> 
      <a href="sodium.html">Sodium</a>
    </h2>
    <p> Unlike oxygen, what might come as a surprise is sodium, but it deserves its spot here as it may be more useful than the average person would think.   </p>
